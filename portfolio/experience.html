                        I started running when I was 8 years old, compteting on my mom's club team Woodside Wildebeests. I played soccer alongside my running until the end of Sophomore year when I decided to focus only on track and cross country. Currently, I mainly run the 800, 1600, and 3200 during track and the 5k during cross country. Next year, I will be running for Cal on both the track and cross country teams.

                        I've found my favorite courses so far to be computer science or history courses so I will probably end up majoring in one of those in college and maybe minoring in the other (I haven't decided which yet).
