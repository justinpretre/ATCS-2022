                        I am currently a 17 year old senior student athlete at Menlo School in Atherton, California. I run track and cross country year round. I will begin studying and running at the University of Calfornia, Berkeley next year in the fall. I am the middle child of one younger brother and one older sister. In my free time, I watch a lot of soccer, specifically the Premier League, play video games, take photos, garden, mountain bike, skiing, and watch TV. My favorite soccer team is Tottenham Hotspur and my favorite player is Richarlison. My favorite video games are Kingdom Come: Deliverance and Rocket League. My favorite TV show is Breaking Bad. My favorite place is Half Moon Bay, California because I love the rain and fog. I think skiing is really fun, but we don't go very often so I'm super bad at it. I don't know how to turn on skis very well so I just go straight down the hill.
